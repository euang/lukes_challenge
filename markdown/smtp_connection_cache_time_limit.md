# smtp_connection_cache_time_limit (default: 2s)
 When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the amount of time that
an unused SMTP client socket is kept open before it is closed. Do
not specify larger values without permission from the remote sites.



 This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.
