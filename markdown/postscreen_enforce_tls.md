# postscreen_enforce_tls (default: $smtpd_enforce_tls)
 Mandatory TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, and
require that clients use TLS encryption. See smtpd\_postscreen\_enforce\_tls
for details. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.
Preferably, use postscreen\_tls\_security\_level instead.
