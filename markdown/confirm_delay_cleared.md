# confirm_delay_cleared (default: no)
 After sending a "your message is delayed" notification, inform
the sender when the delay clears up. This can result in a sudden
burst of notifications at the end of a prolonged network outage,
and is therefore disabled by default. 


 See also: delay\_warning\_time. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.
