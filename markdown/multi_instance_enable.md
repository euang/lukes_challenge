# multi_instance_enable (default: no)
 Allow this Postfix instance to be started, stopped, etc., by a
multi-instance manager. By default, new instances are created in
a safe state that prevents them from being started inadvertently.
This parameter is reserved for the multi-instance manager. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.
