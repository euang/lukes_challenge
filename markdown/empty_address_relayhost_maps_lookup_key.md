# empty_address_relayhost_maps_lookup_key (default: <>)
 The sender\_dependent\_relayhost\_maps search string that will be
used instead of the null sender address. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later. With
earlier versions, sender\_dependent\_relayhost\_maps lookups were
skipped for the null sender address.
