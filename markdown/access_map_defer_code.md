# access_map_defer_code (default: 450)

The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code for
an access(5) map "defer" action, including "defer\_if\_permit"
or "defer\_if\_reject". Prior to Postfix 2.6, the response
is hard-coded as "450".




Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.




This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.
