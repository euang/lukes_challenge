# unknown_virtual_mailbox_reject_code (default: 550)

The Postfix SMTP server reply code when a recipient address matches
$virtual\_mailbox\_domains, and $virtual\_mailbox\_maps specifies a list
of lookup tables that does not match the recipient address.




This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
