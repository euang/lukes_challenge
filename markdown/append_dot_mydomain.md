# append_dot_mydomain (default: Postfix â‰¥ 3.0: no, Postfix < 3.0: yes)

With locally submitted mail, append the string ".$mydomain" to
addresses that have no ".domain" information. With remotely submitted
mail, append the string ".$remote\_header\_rewrite\_domain"
instead.




Note 1: this feature is enabled by default. If disabled, users will not be
able to send mail to "user@partialdomainname" but will have to
specify full domain names instead.



 Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting
happens only when one of the following conditions is true: 


* The message is received with the Postfix sendmail(1) command,
* The message is received from a network client that matches
$local\_header\_rewrite\_clients,
* The message is received from the network, and the
remote\_header\_rewrite\_domain parameter specifies a non-empty value.


 To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify
"local\_header\_rewrite\_clients = static:all".
