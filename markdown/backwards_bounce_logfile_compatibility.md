# backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility (default: yes)

Produce additional bounce(8) logfile records that can be read by
Postfix versions before 2.0. The current and more extensible "name =
value" format is needed in order to implement more sophisticated
functionality.




This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.
