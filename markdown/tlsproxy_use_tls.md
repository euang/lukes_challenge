# tlsproxy_use_tls (default: $smtpd_use_tls)
 Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients,
but do not require that clients use TLS encryption. See smtpd\_use\_tls
for further details. Use tlsproxy\_tls\_security\_level instead. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.
