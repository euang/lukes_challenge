# smtp_sasl_path (default: empty)
 Implementation-specific information that the Postfix SMTP client
passes through to
the SASL plug-in implementation that is selected with
**smtp\_sasl\_type**. Typically this specifies the name of a
configuration file or rendezvous point. 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
