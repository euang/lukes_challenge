# virtual_maps (default: empty)
 Optional lookup tables with a) names of domains for which all
addresses are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains,
and b) addresses that are aliased to addresses in other local or
remote domains. Available before Postfix version 2.0. With Postfix
version 2.0 and later, this is replaced by separate controls: virtual\_alias\_domains
and virtual\_alias\_maps.
