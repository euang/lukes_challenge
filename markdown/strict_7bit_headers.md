# strict_7bit_headers (default: no)

Reject mail with 8-bit text in message headers. This blocks mail
from poorly written applications.




This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server,
because it is likely to reject legitimate email.




This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
