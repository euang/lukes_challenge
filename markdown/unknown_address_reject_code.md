# unknown_address_reject_code (default: 450)

The numerical response code when the Postfix SMTP server rejects a
sender or recipient address because its domain is unknown. This
is one of the possible replies from the restrictions
reject\_unknown\_sender\_domain and reject\_unknown\_recipient\_domain.




Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.
