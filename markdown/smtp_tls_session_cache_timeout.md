# smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout (default: 3600s)
 The expiration time of Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache
information. A cache cleanup is performed periodically
every $smtp\_tls\_session\_cache\_timeout seconds. As with
$smtp\_tls\_session\_cache\_database, this parameter is implemented in the
tlsmgr(8) daemon and therefore per-smtp-instance master.cf overrides
are not possible. 


 As of Postfix 2.11 this setting cannot exceed 100 days. If set
â‰¤ 0, session caching is disabled. If set to a positive value
less than 2 minutes, the minimum value of 2 minutes is used instead. 


 Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s
(seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
The default time unit is s (seconds). 


 This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.
