# expand_owner_alias (default: no)

When delivering to an alias "*aliasname*" that has an
"owner-*aliasname*" companion alias, set the envelope sender
address to the expansion of the "owner-*aliasname*" alias.
Normally, Postfix sets the envelope sender address to the name of
the "owner-*aliasname*" alias.
