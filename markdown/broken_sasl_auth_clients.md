# broken_sasl_auth_clients (default: no)

Enable interoperability with remote SMTP clients that implement an obsolete
version of the AUTH command (RFC 4954). Examples of such clients
are MicroSoft Outlook Express version 4 and MicroSoft Exchange
version 5.0.




Specify "broken\_sasl\_auth\_clients = yes" to have Postfix advertise
AUTH support in a non-standard way.
